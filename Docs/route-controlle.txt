After we create a controller class for our components we can use them in our Route

In our Controller will have the methods for example (index, show, create, store ...)

We use Route to create the Route
We give the method we want to use ::get
We give the route "/"
We call use the HomeController class
We specify the method we want from that class "index"
Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index']);

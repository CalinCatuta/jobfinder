Class controller for our components and website

They will have methods/functions we can see them in ResourceMethods.png


public function index(){
    $jobs = [
        'Wev Developer'
    ]
    We pass the location where is our component 'folder.file' and we pass our variable using compact()
    return view('jobs.index', compact('jobs'))
}


Type Hinting:

use Illuminate\View\View;

We can use this to specify our return from our function 

for example with the index function above we do:
index(): View
